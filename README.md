# Custom NLP Model for Sentiment Analysis

As per [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/milobele/sentiment140-dataset-1600000-tweets)

## Project Summary 
Train model to predict sentiment analysis. This model will the be used to predict Tweets that reference one of the top 5 banks in South Africa.

***Note***: I used mutiple datasets to do this with Sentiment 140 being the main contributor of tweets (1.6 million)
This was automatically labled (using emoticons) and doesnt have neutral tweets labled
